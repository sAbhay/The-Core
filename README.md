# The-Core
<h1>Inspiration </h1>
<p>This project was inspired by iDoz's ProjectCORE that he made on GameMaker. The link to his video is as follows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-QUNRMmLg8 </p>
<br>
<h1>Description </h1>
<p>The goal of the game is to reach 0% by reaching the target, each time reducing the Core's health by 4%. The player's position is the mouseX and mouseY, which is how the player moves. The core fires projectiles at the player. These projectiles bounce off walls and are not removed. The player must avoid all projectiles. The spacebar can be pressed to activate slow motion for a second or so. </p>
